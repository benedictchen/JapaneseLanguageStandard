Standardization of the Japanese Written Language System

The purpose of this repository is to propose changes to the written Japanese language system as it exists today.  
Japanese is a language which dates back thousands of years, but the written system is relatively new and borrowed from
various other languages.  Even as we progress deeper into the year 2020 and beyond, the written form of Japanese lacks 
many parts such as the use of spaces and special characters (question, exclamation marks, etc).  Also, the yomikata (読み方）
for each Kanji（漢字）can be dauntingly excessive (e.g. 「上」、「下」) and vary depending on context, forcing people to guess
based on the rest of the sentence.
